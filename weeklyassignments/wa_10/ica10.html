          My extension is that instead of having a quote and answer button, it's been reworked so that users can guess
          the specific character who said the quote. On the negative side, the API only allows me to have 5 calls an hour,
          which is pretty unfortunate. There is an input box and a guess button. When the user inputs their guess
          and clicks the guess button, feedback is provided indicating whether the guess is correct or not. The user has a 
          limited number of attempts to guess the correct character before the answer is revealed.

          For a critique project I would pull anonymized player telemetry from a games API (skill rating,
          role preference, latency, recent performance, behavioral tags) or a structured events feed.
          That data would let me prototype and evaluate matching strategies (clustering by playstyle,
          latency-aware pairing, fairness checks). Privacy would be prioritized: use aggregated records, 
          keep personal preferences local unless users opt in, and provide clear controls for deleting stored data.
