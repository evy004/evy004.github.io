        <p> My design system reflects parts of my identity through its color and typography choices. 
            The purple palette I chose feels playful yet calm, a balance I associate with how I approach both 
            creative work and life. Purple has also been my favorite color since I was little. The shades range 
            from deep tones to soft pastels to contribute to contrast. For typography, I selected Sour Gummy 
            because of its rounded letterforms. It feels authentic to me because it avoids looking too rigid or 
            formal, which develops personality and makes the system feel approachable and human rather than overly 
            professional. For accessibility, I had to check my color combinations to ensure text was always legible, 
            even against the lighter purples. Some of my initial choices were too light, which meant I had to adjust 
            shades to meet the WCAG contrast standards. This sometimes felt like a trade-off between pure aesthetics 
            and usability. But ultimately, knowing that anyone can read and interact with the system without straining 
            makes the design choices feel more complete. Accessibility had me make more conscious decisions instead 
            of choosing based on pure interest. What surprised me most about building a design system was how many 
            small decisions had to align to create cohesion. Spacing, buttons, and headings all feel minor on their own, 
            but once I organized them under consistent rules, they suddenly made the page feel more unified. I can now 
            carry this system directly into my portfolio, giving it a structured foundation while still leaving room 
            for my personal design choices. In the future, I could expand this system by adding more detailed components 
            like navigation bars, cards, or even animations to create more interactive experiences. I would also refine 
            my documentation so others could understand and use the system without explanation. The most flexible parts 
            seem to be the colors and spacing, since they can scale to different contexts easily. The least flexible 
            element is the typography, since the playful nature of Sour Gummy may not always fit professional or minimal 
            projects. Still, this limitation also helps me define when and where the system best represents me. </p>
