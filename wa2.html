                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>My short-term goal is to do well in my classes this quarter and maintain a good GPA. My long-term goal is 
                    to secure a job at a large tech company, such as Google or Microsoft, after I graduate. This goal was heavily
                    influenced by the movie "The Internship."</p>
